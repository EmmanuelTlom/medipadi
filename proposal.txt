1. Introduction
Medisure Care Services Ltd. (MediPadi) is revolutionizing affordable healthcare
for low-income Nigerians through a prepaid health micro-cover system.
The goal of this MVP is to build a simple, smart, and secure digital platform

at partner providers — while also empowering agents to onboard members
and collect payments.
The MVP will include: 

A member and provider portal accessible via web and mobile. 

A dedicated Agent Module for assisted registration, wallet funding, and
payments.
This ensures MediPadi is positioned both as a trustworthy brand and a
functional platform from day one.
